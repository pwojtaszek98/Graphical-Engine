# PROTOTYPE OF MINECRAFT-LIKE GAME ENGINE MADE IN JAVA 
#
#
#
#
# This project is pure hobby and will be developed and supported in future. 


Currently GE-X contains simple graphical representation for squares, frame counter and basic movement.


# TO BE ADDED:
-sound support
-mouse functionality
-camera orientation
-custom textures

# WHAT I LEARNED (so far):
-java.awt. packages for image processing, event listeners (like keyboard input) and much more!
-java SWING for GUI implementation



# I will be adding documention directly into the code as comments soon. Stay put!
